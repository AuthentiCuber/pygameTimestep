pygameTimestep
========
Timestep is a module based on Pygame that implements a decoupled update and rendering to make any code framerate independant. Based on https://gafferongames.com/post/fix_your_timestep/#the-final-touch. Created so you never have to worry about multiplying by deltatime again.

Why?
--------
Multiplying everything by deltatime is annoying and sometimes doesn't work.

Installation
--------
Simply download [timestep.py](https://github.com/AuthentiCuber/pygameTimestep/blob/master/timestep.py), put it in your project folder and you're good to go!
